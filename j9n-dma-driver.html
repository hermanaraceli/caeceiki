As the title says, I think my graphics card has a lot of wasted potential. Whenever I get on a game, the settings are automatically set to a much higher level than my computer can handle, and I'm pretty sure my graphics card should be able to deal with it just fine. Any help that can be given is greatly appreciated, and if you need anymore information, just ask me!

First off the GPU works well, my only issue is I cannot access/see BIOS, upon restart of computer I get a black screen until the windows start screen. If I press F8 or F2 upon start the screen stays black for evermore (so I think I have accessed it but cannot see it). I doubt it is a power issue as I have a Corsair 600w PLUS Bronze Power Supply Unit. Standard motherboard vga wont work and neither will standard HDMI cable upon startup. Any ideas would be much appreciated -----------------. Direct memory access (DMA)  To initiate a data transfer the device driver sets up the DMA channel's address and count registers together with the direction of the data transfer, read or write. It then instructs the DMA hardware to begin the transfer. My PC will completely freeze 5-6 times a day. I can still hear sound from Skype and sometimes other things that I have open. The screen freezes on whatever i was looking at but has turned completely black a few times.

Hello, this is my first time posting in this subreddit, so sorry if I'm not doing something accordingly. I recently bought the game Awesomenauts for my PC through Steam.

Click on the following links for the driver package readme info:./extract/Readme.txt This package supports the following driver models:CMD PCI-0640. Hello, We are developing high performance crypto ip cores and drivers for them running in Petalinux on Zynq SoC. We thought that the best option for high speed data transfer is using AXI stream interface with AXI DMA. Is there any other legitimate way? When we use AXI DMA, we need to control it over linux kernel drivers. We saw that the best option is using linux dma\_engine driver, however it lacks of good documentation and examples ready to use. In addition, scatter-gather mode works 
The Xilinx PCI Express DMA IP provides high-performance direct memory access (DMA) via PCI Express. The PCIe DMA supports UltraScale+, UltraScale, Virtex-7 XT and 7 Series Gen2 devices; the provided driver can be used for all of these devices. This answer record provides drivers and software. Hey all, I've been taking some courses about ARM and I wonder how important is Direct Memory Access in embedded industry. The Expresso DMA Driver creates and manages descriptor chains in system memory. The Expresso DMA Core then fetch-es and executes these descriptor chains. This approach ena-bles the descriptor chain size to be maximized while minimiz-. With the new update I noticed that the graphics settings were reset. Took my computer dying 2 times to notice. I logged in and had about 3 min to set everything to the lowest setting and save then exit. You see, even the lowest was too much for my computer. This is alright that's how it was before. I went into the WTF config folder and changed the settings even lower there in order to play before. The issue NOW, I set everything 50%-90% lower, but when I log in the game the graphics.

We're considering a transition from MCUs and DSPs to FPGA SoCs running embedded Linux. I'm curious as to how people prefer to do memory mapped I/O to access discretes and other registers. In the past on bare metal and RTOS, one could use things like: volatile uint16_t const PORTA = 0xC0000000; PORTA = 0x1U; // read back uint16_t value = PORTA I know I can open the /dev file corresponding to system memory and mmap it. We can also create kernel drivers and read/write. This video walks through the process of creating a PCI Express solution that uses the new 2016.1 DMA for PCI Express IP Subsystem.

The Direct Rendering Manager resides in kernel space, so the user space programs must use kernel system calls to request its services. However, DRM doesn't define. Direct memory access (DMA) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory (random-access memory), independent.
