Camel - Breathless (1978/2009, Esoteric Recordings, ECLEC 2155). I’d like to begin by saying that I don’t really use social media. I prefer to spend my time working, or tinkering among other things. My distance from social media isn’t exactly voluntary. Sure, part of it is inspired by my upbringing, but large part of it is to avoid the big “G” word. I don’t hate religions, granted.

So I don't think I've ever had as much trouble with a band as I have with Camel, because they both made some of the best music I've ever heard and some of the worst. At this point I own 3 of their albums: Rajaz, Mirage ,and Breathless  Rajaz is actually proving to be one of my all time favorite albums. I absolutely adore it. There are some misses on it (looking at you, Shout ), but the winners are fantastic! Sahara, Lawrence, Rajaz, Straight to my Heart, and even though it often. If you're like me, The Mummy was a childhood favorite, and The Mummy Returns was a fun and serviceable sequel. A beloved franchise that deserved a better third installment than the unfettered excrement of Mummy 3. Then Maria Bello, China, Jet Li, Alex O'Connell turns American, oh boy.
