I have recently started playing DayZ again, i joined a random vanilla server, i looted, ran a lot and started building a base, all as normal, i found 1 single rope in that life. Then i died. That's when things just broke, cans/tins no longer spawned on their own, only in loot from zombies/inside clothes, i have been living off of fruit and the occasional soda (which i feel are much rarer also). 4 out of every 5 times i find loot in sheds or industrial buildings it ended up being rope. –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏–µ –≤—ã–∂–∏–≤—à–∏–µ, –í–æ—Ç –∏ –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—á–∏–ª—Å—è 2018 –≥–æ–¥, –ø–æ—Ä–∞ –æ—Ç—á–∏—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é –∑–∞ –≥–æ–¥ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É. Just curious if anyone would be able to port this over? I miss that map just the way is was spread out but also had choke points. On the server i played on upon restart there were biplanes and little white planes scatterd across the map so it made it fun to fly around. 2500+ hours on that map with my 8 man squad. amp#x200B; I wish the devs would just bring What Happens If You Save The Serial Killer Prostitute From Hanging In Red Dead Redemption 2?

How easy is it just to port maps from the old Arma Games to DayZ Standalone? These maps had so much diversity and were all so great. Big, little, snowy, tropical. I would love to play on Sahrani, Taviana, Isla Duala, Podagorsk, Takistan, Falluja, Zelle, Utes and of course the big 3 Panthera Taviana and Lingor. I know Namalsk is coming, and i appreciate the effort the map maker puts into it to make it perfect. But i would gladly accept just the pure port of the other Maps, since im startin.

Easier modded servers will most likely have a larger player base than vanilla, just like in the mod, because most people would rather get geared in 1 hour instead of 3. Some people on this subreddit are arguing that this is bad, as less people will be playing vanilla. They would rather have us all playing vanilla instead of playing the way we want.
